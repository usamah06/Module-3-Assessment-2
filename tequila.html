                <h2>About our Tequila:</h2>
                <p>Tequila is a distilled alcoholic beverage made primarily from the blue agave plant, primarily in the region surrounding the city of Tequila in Mexico. It has a distinctive flavor profile, ranging from sweet and fruity to earthy and spicy, depending on its production process and aging. Tequila is classified into several types, including blanco (unaged), reposado (aged 2-12 months), añejo (aged 1-3 years), and extra añejo (aged over 3 years). Often enjoyed straight or in cocktails like the Margarita, tequila is known for its vibrant culture and traditions</p>
